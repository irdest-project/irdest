# irde.st website

This directory contains the sources, templates, and content of the
Irdest project website (that can be found at
[https://irde.st](https://irde.st)).

We would really appreciate content suggestions (for example, working
on explanations of the technological and social principles of the
project), as well as translations for existing texts.  If you are
interested in this, please get in touch :)
