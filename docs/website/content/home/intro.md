Resilient_Title: Build resilient networks
Resilient: |
    Centralised communication infrastructure is vulnerable to exploitation
    or attacks by natural disasters, oppressive governments, or gate-keepers
    of digital connections (i.e. internet service providers).  _Irdest side-steps
    existing infrastructure_ to allow network participants to take ownership
    of the infrastructure together.  This also makes it much harder to censor or control.
Extensible_Title: An extensible architecture
Extensible: |
    An Irdest network can be composed of both devices and
    other networks, creating a network of networks; _a new internet_.  With
    the Irdest client SDK third-party applications can interact with other
    instances of itself on an Irdest network, or on an alternatively managed
    network bridged via Irdest.
FOSS_Title: Free and open-source software
FOSS: |
    Irdest is not owned by a single company or legal entity.  All code
    is licensed under a free software license.  This means it is free
    for anyone to use, study, and adapt, forever.
