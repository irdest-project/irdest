Resilient_Title: Build resilient networks
Resilient: |
    Centralised communication infrastructure is vulnerable to exploitation
    or attacks by natural disasters, oppersive governments, or the gate-keepers
    of digital connections.  Irdest side-steps existing infrastructure to allow
    network participants to take ownership of the infrastructure together.
    This also makes it much harder to censor or control.
Extensible_Title: An extensible architecture
Extensible: |
    An Irdest network can be composed of both devices and
    other networks, creating a network of networks; a new internet.  With
    the Irdest client SDK third-party applications can interact with other
    instances of itself on an Irdest network.
FOSS_Title: Free and open-source software
FOSS: |
    Irdest is not owned by a single company or legal entity.  All code
    is licensed under a free software license.  This means it is free
    for anyone to use, study, and adapt, forever.
