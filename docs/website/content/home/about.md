Introduction_Title: What is Irdest?
Introduction: |

    **Irdest is a networking research project** that explores
    different technologies and ideas on how to build more sustainable,
    user-controlled communication networks.

    Whether you are connected to the internet via your home ISP
    (internet service provider) or via a mobile phone network,
    powerful and complex organisations sit between you and your
    ability to communicate with other people.

    As part of an *Irdest network* your home computer, laptop,
    router, phone, etc connect to each other directly, creating a
    *dynamic mesh network*.  This means that the communication
    infrastructure that we collectively rely on to organise ourselves
    needs to in turn become collectively organised and managed.  This
    approach is very different from the "internet service" you usually
    currently buy from a company.

    **A lot of decentralised networking technology already exists!** A
    primary motivation for the Irdest project is to take decades of
    research in this field and make it more accessible to end-users
    and curious software developers alike.

    With the Irdest SDK you can write applications that are *native to
    a decentralised mesh network* and don't require a central server,
    or access to the internet to operate!

Meshing_Title: How does Irdest work?
Meshing: |

    At the heart of an Irdest network sits Ratman, a *router
    application* that runs on phones, computers, laptops, and other
    devices.  Different Ratman instances can be connected over a wide
    range of connection types.

    Communicating between Ratman instances works seemlessly, the same
    way as devices on a WiFi network can, with the added ability to
    link these networks over long distances or across the entire
    world.

    Connections between Ratman instances can be created via local
    networks, long-range LoRa modems, peer-to-peer Wireless
    connections, or over the internet as a VPN-like network.

    Applications using an Irdest network can discover and connect with
    each other by first connecting to a local Ratman instance.  _The
    range of possible applications using this technology is
    limitless._
