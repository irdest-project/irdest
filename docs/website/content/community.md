Do you have questions about irdest?  Trouble setting up your client?
Or do you want to help out with development?

We have an active community on Matrix!  [Join the Matrix
Space](https://matrix.to/#/#irdest:irde.st).

Alternatively you can find the most important channels linked directly
below.  Currently none of the rooms are bridged to IRC.  We are
working on this!
