# Installation instructions

This section explains how to install Ratman and other Irdest tools on
your computer.  Currently Ratman is mostly tested on Linux.  It should
work on Linux and macOS.  ([Windows testing
needed](https://git.irde.st/we/irdest/-/issues/78))

There may be a package on your Linux distribution.  If it is
up-to-date, feel free to use it.  In other cases, you can use the
Irdest stand-alone installer, detailed in the next section.

If the installer doesn't support your platform (currently only
`x86_64-linux` and `aarch64-linux`), you can also install Irdest from
source.
