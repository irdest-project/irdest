# How to install Irdest

Irdest is mainly being developed on Linux, but partially supports
macOS as well.  If you have a Windows computer, you can [help test
things](https://git.irde.st/we/irdest/-/issues/78)!

A package for your Linux distribution may be available (check the
Irdest website [download page](https://irde.st/download) for an
overview).

We recommend you only use up-to-date packages, due to the fast rate of
change in the project at the moment.  If no up-to-date package is
available, you can use the Irdest stand-alone installer, detailed in
the next section.

If the installer doesn't support your platform (currently only
`x86_64-linux` and `aarch64-linux`), you can alternatively install
Irdest from source.
