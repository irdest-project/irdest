# Reference

A general reference for configuration options and terms.  Every
component is organised into its own section and can explain more
context than the built-in help text of many tools.

**Note:** keeping a reference section of a manual up-to-date is hard
and can sometimes be forgotten.  If you find any part of this
reference to be out-of-date, please open an issue about it!

Documentation patches welcome! ðŸ¥º
