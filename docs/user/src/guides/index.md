# Setup Guides

This section of the manual focuses on practical setup instructions for
an Irdest network with Ratman and other applications.  Each guide is
tailored to a specific use-case, with some being more broad than
others.

Ideally your use-case will be covered.  In case it is not, hopefully
you can adapt one of the existing guides to your settings.  But please
also feel free to [talk to us](https://irde.st/community/) about what
the documentation should include!
