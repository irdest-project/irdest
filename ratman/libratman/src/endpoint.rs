///
/// All functions work without mutability because an endpoint is
/// expected to implement some access multiplexing or rely on atomic
/// operations to ensure thread safety.  This is because it's not
/// reasonable for an endpoint driver to rely purely on Rust's
/// ownership and mutability model, because it will inevitably have to
/// interact with system components, other buffers that push into a
/// queue, or similar.
///
/// This interface doesn't care about the implementation details of
/// these endpoints, and so, to make matters simpler for the router,
/// and to make it obvious that internal mutability needs to be used,
/// this interface is immutable by default.
