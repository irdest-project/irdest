## TLDR

When building `ratmand` via `cargo` you will have to first build and
bundle the web dashboard:

```
$ env -C ratman/dashboard yarn
$ env -C ratman/dashboard yarn build
$ cargo build --bin ratmand --all-features
```

When hacking on the dashboard itself remember to point it at the
`ratmand` instance you would like to use:

```
$ cd ratman/dashboard
$ yarn start --proxy=http://localhost:8090
```
