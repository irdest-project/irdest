//! An announce test on a three-node network
//!
//! This test is similar to the one featured in the root doc page,
//! except that the network is a bit more complicated.  This test
//! implements a three-node network, meaning that messages _have_ to
//! be re-transmitted by a middle router.
//!
//! From experience, these kinds of low-level, distributed tests are
//! good at catching errors in the code, but also demonstrate how the
//! concepts in Ratman scale.
//!
//! Because a `MemMod` is always 1-to-1, we need to create two, and
//! then add two interfaces to the middle router.
