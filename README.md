[![Built with Nix](https://builtwithnix.org/badge.svg)](https://builtwithnix.org)

**Irdest** is a decentralised networking project, aiming to create
easy-to-use solutions for ad-hoc wireless, and mesh networks.  It
supports many common desktop operating systems (Linux, Windows, MacOS,
NetBSD, â€¦), and Android mobile phones.  iOS support is on the roadmap.

The core component of the Irdest project is **Ratman**, a
decentralised, peer-to-peer packet router (following the [gossip
protocol] approach), written in [Rust].  With Ratman you can create
private overlay networks (similar to VPNs), connect to a wider
community mesh of existing overlay networks, plug into specific
wireless drivers for fully off-the-grid routing, or do all of them at
the same time.

Following is an overview of the available components.  Components have
additional information in their respective README files.

## Overview

Most traditional networking infrastructure (both the transmission
layer, as well as applications) operate in a centralised way.  Clients
connect to servers, and devices to [ISP]s.  This makes the
infrastructure vulnerable to attacks.  Natural disasters or opressive
governments can easily shut down communication for millions of people,
potentially putting them at risk, and slowing down or disrupting any
organisation or activist movement.

Irdest aims to solve this issue by creating decentralised circuits
between devices directly.  These direct device-to-device connections
can be imperfect and unstable.  Irdest's routing approach takes these
issues into account by caching undelivered messages, and carrying them
towards their destination until the receipient comes back online.

Routing in an Irdest network is done via a user's **ed25519 public
keys**, creating a 32 byte large address space (twice as lange as
IPv6).  Connecting devices together happens via channel-specific
drivers (for example the tcp internet overlay). Therefore when
creating a circuit, roaming between different connection types is
normal, and no single connection technology has to work on all
possible devices or platforms.
