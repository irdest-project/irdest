# Changelog

All notable changes to Irdest are documented in this file. The sections should
follow the order `Releases`, `Added`, `Changed`, `Fixed`, `Removed`, and
`Security`.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).


## 0.5.0

The probably biggest Irdest release so far.  It brings many minor and some major
changes to the codebase and usability of the project.  Importantly, Irdest is
once again grant funded (via NLnet â™¥).

The changelog has also been changed in structure, since this monorepo consists
of lots of components, each with their own release versions.  We'll experiment
with different changelog formats for future releases to make it more clear what
changes were made to which components.

Hope you enjoy!

### Releases

- Ratman daemon (ratmand) `0.5.0`
- ratcat `0.5.0`
- ratctl `0.5.0`
- libratman `0.5.0`
- Irdest mblog `0.1.0`

### Added

- LoRa connection support via `netmod-lora`.  See the user manual on how to set
  up a LoRa modem.
- Managed WiFi connection support via `netmod-datalink` (supports Linux/
  NetworkManager)
- `ratmand generate` command to pre-generate a ratmand configuration.  Overrides
  can be applied with the `--patch` (for simple key=value configuration
  settings) and `--add-peer` (for peers) arguments.
- Locally registered addresses and routing tables are now persisted on disk
  between restarts.
- Frames that fail to be delivered are now cached in an on-disk journal instead
  of being dropped
- Blocks are cached on disk while a large message stream is being encoded.  For
  large message streams this means that the router will no longer run out of
  memory and crash.  Currently we hold back the whole message stream until all
  blocks are encoded to allow the manifest to be sent first.

### Changed

- Router dashboard now updates automatically and shows connection statistics for
  peers
- User and developer manuals were completely overhauled
- The Ratman configuration now uses the KDL language, which supports comments
  and nested blocks, without getting unwielding to edit.
- Management functions (register addresses and subscriptions) has been moved
  from `ratcat` to `ratctl`
- Both `ratcat` and `ratctl` commandline interfaces have been overhauled
- 
- Many internal and external structural changes that aren't directly reflected
  in the user experience, but will make development and maintenance easier and
  faster in the future
  - The developer facing crates `ratman-client`, `ratman-netmod`,
    `ratman-types`, etc have been consolidated into `libratman` -- `ratman` on
    crates.io, which was previously the daemon.
  - The daemon crate is now called `ratmand` and no longer available on
    crates.io.

### Fixed

- Announcement forwarding would sometimes be interrupted
- Messages are once again encrypted by default
- Ratman SDK would sometimes send invalid API messages

### Security

- Replaced libsodium signatures and encryption with native Rust alternatives
  - ed25519-dalek is used for signatures, key management and secret negotiation
  - chacha20 is used for block encryption as per the [ERIS] specification

### Known bugs

- Due to [kdl issue #65](https://github.com/kdl-org/kdl-rs/issues/65)
  insertions made to the `peers` block of the ratmand configuration
  produce wrong formatting for the first entry.


## 0.4.0 (2022-04-16)

### Added

- `ratmand` supports `--daemonize` and `--pidfile` CLI arguments
- Support socket activating `ratmand` on the API socket
- `ratmand` now stores configuration values in
  `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/ratmand/config.json` and can be launched without providing
  any command line arguments
- `ratmand` now serves a simple dashboard on `localhost:8090` to list known
  network addresses


### Changed

- Network flood messages are now namespaced via an address, instead of going to
  every participant
- `netmod-inet` has been simplified


### Fixed

- Peering discovery via `netmod-lan` no longer results in broadcast loops
- Peering via `netmod-inet` now works more consistently
